# TRIAL STAFF RULES

In order to maintain the best operational standards and reputation of KygekTeam, both internally and externally, **all trial staffs are mandated** to follow the following staff rules.

**1. Be active and collaborative**
An organization needs staffs with motivation to build and improve the organization (just look at other organizations, they have active staffs). The same thing happens with KygekTeam, which needs continuous collaboration and teamwork from its staffs. That's why I named KygekTeam as well recruited you, or accepted your staff application.

**2. Respect and be polite to other staffs**
Respect the Founder because he have worked hard to build KygekTeam from scratch. Respect other staffs because each of us are unique and precious. Be polite because you'll not always know if you indeed hurt other people.

**3. Follow the general server rules (#ðŸ“˜ï¸²rules)**
Being a staff doesn't mean having freedom from general server rules and only controlled by special set of rules. These staff rules are just an extension of the general server rules. Your authority may be revoked if you do not take the rules seriously.

**4. Serve members users as best as possible**
We emphasize good service to maximize satisfaction as well to bring confidence to members and users. Do not behave like you're a boss.

**5. You are responsible with your status and reputation**
Think carefully before making decisions for other people. Failing to meet our rules and standards may affect your status and reputation directly nor indirectly.

**6. Be initiative**
Do not wait for KygekDev to message you. Message KygekDev instead, because he is more active than you think, and you're not as active and free as KygekDev.

**7. Creating, initiating, modifying or deleting stuffs must under consent of KygekDev**
Adding bots, modifying Discord servers or initiating new projects are not permitted without prior consent from KygekDev.

**8. All staffs should show signs of activity at least once every 2-3 days**
An exception is made if a given staff have a strong reason to not be active in KygekDev and has contacted KygekDev personally prior to inactivity.

**9. Only do things related with KygekTeam when contributing to KygekTeam**
Utilizing staff positions for interests that are not related with KygekTeam, such as advertising external mediums, are strictly prohibited, except under special approval from KygekDev.

Any violations of the server and general rules **will be moderated by the Leader**.

# Teamwork in KygekTeam

We value teamwork **very highly**. We believe that **great teamwork** leads to **great results**. Therefore, every contributor **must** build a good teamwork in KygekTeam.

Read this: **KYGEKTEAM**. Yes, there's `team` word in our organization name. That's how **valuable** teamwork is according to us. Teamwork is not a **choice** while contributing to KygekTeam, but it is an **obligation**.

## IMPORTANT !!!

**WE ARE NOT A BUSINESS!**

**Never** expect you will be paid when contributing to KygekTeam. We make projects **because of people** and **for people**. I founded KygekTeam with the **mission** of **making people easier and helping people to work with PocketMine-MP and other projects**.

Do you know that I'm **not being paid** for contributing KygekTeam, even for a **single penny**? And do you know that I'm still **motivated** to contribute **even if** I'm not being paid?

Some people may think that **I'm stupid**, because I could have **earned hundreds of dollars** if I'm being paid. Yes, I do need money. But I believe that in the future, somebody will help KygekTeam to continue operating.

I contribute to KygekTeam **not** because of money. But for the purpose of the **gaining and improving** my **experience, knowledge, skill, hobby** and for my **overall masterplan** (which you do not need to know about). Therefore, I'm **looking for people** to contribute together with me through KygekTeam will the purpose of **learning and caring**.

**Remember this:** If you want to **be paid** or **be famous** by contributing to KygekTeam, then KygekTeam is **not and never** be for you.
